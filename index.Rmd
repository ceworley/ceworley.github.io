# Chad Worley

Hello! Welcome to my index page. I have a wide range of interests that I hope to link from here.

My largest github project is [statqs](https://ceworley.github.io/statqs): randomly-enumerated introductory-statistics questions with [online tools](online_tools.html) and [videos](https://vimeo.com/chadworley).

Here are some links to my favorite game-theory explorations:

* [Simultaneous duels](duel.html){target="blank"}
* [Simultaneous poker](simpok_game.html){target="blank"}
* [HORSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BavFoN_sz4){target="blank"}

A while ago I made some Blender tutorials (my most watched videos)

* [Making a cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79BB2pjRsJg){target="blank"}
* [Making a Depth Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPwdLOSpMUA){target="blank"}
