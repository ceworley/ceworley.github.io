Hello! Welcome to my index page. I have a wide range of interests that I hope to link from here.

My largest github project is [statqs](https://ceworley.github.io/statqs): randomly-enumerated introductory-statistics questions with [online tools](online_tools.html) and [videos](https://vimeo.com/chadworley).

Here are some links to my favorite mathematical/STEM explorations:

* [Simultaneous duels](duel.html){target="blank"}
* [Simultaneous poker](simpok_game.html){target="blank"}
* [HORSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BavFoN_sz4){target="blank"}
* [Transit photometry](transit.pdf){target="blank"}
* [Gray-Scott Reaction-Diffusion on a Growing Domain](AlgArt.pdf){target="blank"}
* [Arithmetic Introduction](arith.pdf){target="blank"}
* [Scientific Crossword](xword.png){target="blank"}

I am handy with Blender (3D animation):

My poem in iambic polymeter:

> Against the gentle scent of afternoon  
> reflections melt, collapse. Above, a loon,  
> sullen perhaps, laments a lover's tune  
> that lasts all eve and features the half moon.
